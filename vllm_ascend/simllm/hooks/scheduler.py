"""Diagnostic scheduler-adjacent helpers for Sim-LLM deferral signals.

Phase 3 keeps deferral as future/backlog input only.  This module may track
which requests would have been candidates, but it must not re-queue, delay, or
reorder requests.

    This is diagnostic-only in the current implementation.  The ``scheduler``

    ----------
    deferral_indices:
        Batch indices of tasks to defer.
    req_ids:
        Request IDs for the batch (ordered).
    scheduler:

    max_deferrals:

    -------
    Updated *deferral_counts* dict (same object if passed in).  These counts do
    not affect scheduling in the current phase.
